Typically, you should include fields such as Email, First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Tags, and any relevant custom fields.Name the Export: Enter a name for the export file. Important: Avoid using special characters (e.g., !, #, $) as these may cause issues when importing into HighLevel.Download Export: Click Export. ActiveCampaign will generate a CSV file which you can download once it’s ready. This file will contain all the selected contact information.Step 2: Prepare CSV for HighLevel ImportCheck Date Formats: Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.Encode Special Characters: Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.Clean Up Data: Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.Verify Email Addresses: Confirm that each contact in the CSV has a valid email address, as this is a required field for importing into HighLevel.Step 3: Import Contacts into HighLevelLog in to HighLevel: Navigate to the Contacts section using the left-hand menu.Start Import Process: Click the Import Contacts button.Upload CSV File: Select and upload the prepared CSV file.Map Fields: HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel.

Reply Tracking is also elaborated.Where to Find Reply & Forward SettingsOnce you are in the location, click on Settings -> Email ServicesForwarding AddressIf a lead responds to an email, that response is always going to show up in Conversations tab, however, if you want a COPY of the lead’s email response to go to someone’ email, you could put in that email address there. All incoming and outgoing emails (To, CC, and BCC) will be charged.You could enter multiple forwarding email addresses here separated by a comma, e.g. email1@test.com, email2@test.com, email3@test.comIMPORTANT: Forwarding address and BCC Emails ONLY work when using Mailgun and LC Email. We don't support other smtp providers.Reply AddressNow we have the option to Add a reply-to address. All incoming emails will be sent to that email address instead of routing to the Conversation tab.When you reply to the leads' email in your inbox outside the CRM, your reply will not sync back to the CRM.You will be able to add up to 5 email addresses.This can be configured in Settings> Email Services> Reply & Forward Settings> Reply Address.Make sure to Save once you have entered a Reply Address.BCC EmailsYou will receive a Blind Carbon Copy of every email that goes out from that location. This is configurable from Settings> Email Services> Reply & Forward Settings> BCC EmailsForward to Assigned UserThe assigned user of the lead will receive the email replies in their Email Inbox. The Email will be sent to the Email address for that user in Settings> My Staff> edit User> User InfoEnable Reply Tracking - Other SMTP ProvidersThere's no option to enable reply tracking for Mailgun since it's directly integrated with the Receiving route set up in Mailgun. Click here to learn more about: How to setup Replies in MailGun.If you mask the sender email like testing@gmail.com, the reply-to address will show as testing@replies.subdomain.com, which is the Mailgun subdomain we set up for the location in Agency Settings-> Mailgun.Replies will still appear correctly in the Sub-account's Conversation tab. Example With Reply TrackingThe highlighted email shown in the screenshot below will be the reply-to email address. So we can capture the email replies back into the Conversation tab to read, manually respond or trigger a response using tags, etc. This will be the limitation of using SMTP integration. IMPORTANT: We are not able to get email replies back to the Conversation tab if we copy the highlighted email below and send a direct email/ initiate a new email thread with it. We will need to reply to the email sent from the system.Example Without Reply TrackingThe highlighted email shown in the screenshot below will be the reply-to email address. We will not be able to capture the email replies back into the Conversation tab. But responses will be going to the configured sender email in the inbox.Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: Why the attached files do not get forwarded along with the email replies?A: The forward settings in the email services tab do not support forwarding attachments. So if the contact replies to the emails with an attachment, we will need to log in to the HighLevel conversation view to see it.Q: Why do the forwarding emails I've added disappear after attempting to save?A: If the email addresses are invalid, or they collide with any dedicated domains added to your sub-account, they cannot be used as a forwarding address.\nDid you find it helpful?\nYes\nNoSend feedback Sorry we couldn't be helpful.

After putting so much work into your email marketing, you want to be sure that your messages are actually being seen by your Subscribers! This is why deliverability is crucial. How is deliverability determined?There are a lot of factors that influence inbox placement. In general, mailbox providers are trying to determine three things:Is the message safe?Is the message wanted by most Subscribers?Is the message wanted by this particular Subscriber?If the answer to all three questions is yes, the message belongs in the inbox. If any of the answers above are no, this message belongs in the spam folder. To make this decision, mailbox providers typically turn to the sender reputation they have calculated for you. Sender ReputationMailbox providers, such as Gmail, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc., create a reputation score for your sending domain. You can think of this like a credit score, but unfortunately there’s no one source of truth that can indicate exactly what your score is and why. Mailbox providers keep your score, and the algorithms used to determine it, private. However, the most important determining factor is the way that Subscribers engage (or don’t engage) with your message.Subscriber EngagementThe best way for mailbox providers to determine where your mail belongs is by seeing how your Subscribers interact with it. There are actions your Subscribers can take that will raise your sender reputation, and actions that will lower your sender reputation. Here are some recommendations for promoting positive engagement:List HealthOnly import Subscribers who have given you direct permission to receive email marketing. Quality is much more important than quantity when it comes to email marketing. You don’t want anyone on your list who doesn’t want to be there. For the best deliverability, be sure everyone on your list knew exactly what they were signing up for.Secure your Forms with a double opt-in and/or ReCaptcha. If your Form isn’t secure, there’s a good chance you’ll start to see bots abusing it. We talk more about why this is harmful to your deliverability here.Prune your list regularly. Be sure you don’t let Cold Subscribers pile up. If you don’t clean your list regularly, the unengaged Subscribers will start to become the majority. When this happens, your sender reputation drops and more messages start to be filtered to spam. Learn more about how to prune your list here.ConsistencyAn important component to your sender reputation is consistency. If there is any sudden change to the way you send messages, mailbox providers will see your messages as risky and potentially place it in the spam folder. Here are some characteristics you’ll want to keep consistent:Sending Domain: It’s perfectly fine to send from multiple domains, but be sure the domain you’re sending from is the domain that Subscribers will recognize. Avoid sending from a brand new domain or a domain that has not sent any mail in a long time (over 6 months). Volume: Be sure to send to a consistent number of Subscribers each week. It’s normal for your list to shrink and grow, but try not to have any major volume swings. (You don’t want to go jump from 5,000 Subscribers to 20,000 Subscribers overnight!) If you need to introduce a large number of new Subscribers, be sure to start sending to them in small batches so you don’t alarm mailbox providers.Frequency: Send at least once per month to keep your sender reputation established. If mailbox providers don’t see enough mail from you, they won’t be able to maintain a reputation for you and you’ll be starting from scratch on your next send. Also, be sure not to send too frequently to Subscribers -- it could cause them to mark your messages as spam! We recommend asking your Subscribers ahead of time how often they’d like to hear from you and give them the ability to modify their preferences in each email.ContentWhile content matters much less than it used to when it comes to inbox placement, it still has the potential to influence your deliverability - especially if your sender reputation isn’t well established. If mailbox providers haven’t seen consistency from you like we covered above, they might not have enough information to decide whether your message is safe and wanted. This means they might need to rely on your content as another data point to make this decision.On the flip side, if mailbox providers have seen enough consistent volume from you that they have confidence in the way you’ve been scored, they’re more likely "

You'll want to be sure to send mail from a domain that you own and that matches your branding.DMARCIf the domain you use to send mail has a DMARC policy but you haven't verified the domain in with your SMTP provider, your messages will likely go to spam. Check with your SMTP provider for instructions on how to ensure your HighLevel messages pass DMARC.List Health & List CollectionIf all of the technical pieces above are covered, list health and list collection are the next most important factors to determine deliverability. Be sure that:Everyone on your list gave direct consent to receive email marketing from youYour cold subscribers are cleaned from your list regularlyYour forms are secured with double opt-inTo learn more about why messages go to the inbox or spam folder, check out our Introduction To Email Deliverability article.Sending Internal MailAre you sending messages to the same domain that the message is coming from? For example, sending from info@exampledomain.com to suan@exampledomain.com. If so, it's common for these internal messages to go to spam. This is because your mailbox sees that it's receiving a message from itself, but it knows that it didn't send the message (HighLevel did). This makes your mailbox think it's being spoofed, and it sends the message to spam.If you're just sending internal mail to test your messages, we recommend using a free email like gmail.com. If you need to send mail internally outside of testing, you'll want to have the person who manages mail for your domain whitelist the IP address of your SMTP provider.\nDid you find it helpful?\nYes\nNoSend feedback Sorry we couldn't be helpful.

Where do we see Deliverability?First, let’s make sure we’re on the same page regarding the difference between “Delivered” and “Deliverability” because they are very different!*DELIVERED* This is the stat you see in your SMTP dashboard or in your Highlevel email stats (along with opens, replies, clicks, bounces, complaints, etc.)Examples:[Mailgun Dashboard][Highlevel Campaign]Delivery just means the email got to the recipient mail server – somewhere – could be the inbox, spam, promotions, updates – who freaking knows where it landed??? It’s also possible the mail server will choose not to hand it off to the email account, but that’s not as likely since most mail servers would prefer to outright reject the email and provide that feedback to the sender. ... You know... like when the postal carrier marks your package as \"delivered\" in their system, but it's nowhere to be found in your mailbox so you start hunting around your doorstep and asking neighbors if they got it by mistake, but it’s nowhere to be found ? (sorry... went off on a tangent there!)A good Delivery rate is 98%+Because – what’s the alternative? The opposite of Delivered is Undelivered… meaning it didn’t get delivered AT ALL. It failed or bounced or got rejected by the receiving mail server – none of those are what we want.NOTE: Delivered is a stat MOST email marketing tools DO NOT share with you! Why? Because they’d have to answer to it.  Instead, they show how many people went into a campaign or automation, then skip right over Delivered and just show the Open rate.For those using Mailgun with Highlevel, every stat is visible. So, unlike other email tools, Highlevel lets you have full visibility into your delivery rates, and direct communication with your own SMTP provider, which means the power is entirely in your hands to get the best possible results from your email marketing efforts. THIS is why I love the Highlevel/Mailgun combination so much! No other email toolset gives this much opportunity for excellent deliverability.*DELIVERABILITY*Unlike Delivery, Deliverability is a stat you don’t see anywhere.Deliverability = Inbox Placement… in other words your Inboxing Rate – how much of your email hits the Inbox vs. other folders (like Spam or Junk or Promotions…) or not delivering at all.Email Service Providers do not provide this level of detail in their feedback loops, so we don’t actually see stats related to which folders our email is landing in - only if it was delivered.A Good Deliverability rate would obviously be ?%Although, there’s no such thing as 100% to the inbox, every time, it’s important to understand some of the factors that play into it, so we can come as close to 100% as possible.Things like:IP and domain reputationReputation is KEY! Many, many things affect reputation, but there are 2 main categories that weigh heavily… Volume and Consistency, and the almighty Engagement (opens, clicks, replies, bounces, complaints, unsubscribes). For more information on stats, check out “What Email Deliverability Stats Should I Look For?”.Individual Email Service Provider (ESP) filtering preferencesGoogle, Yahoo!, Outlook, etc. - they don’t all filter exactly the same… There are 100s of things that play into email deliverability, but none of these companies provide a whitepaper with their filtering logicAuthenticationThose pesky DNS records - the SPFs, DKIMs, and DMARCs of the world. And don’t forget your MX records… if those aren’t configured correctly that could also land you in spam or even prevent delivery.Domain ageWhether it’s a root domain or a subdomain, age factors into warm-up considerations. Treat your new domain like a first date… the goal being to get a second date. When you show up at the door with a new domain, you have no history and no reputation, so make sure to start sending slow and don’t rush things. A good reputation can overcome a young domain age.Domain suffixSome of them have a bad rep from the start! The most trustworthy domain suffixes are .com, .co, .net, and .org (.edu and .gov for those who can use them) There are others that work well and some that can send you directly to the spam folder. See how your domain suffix rates here.Subject line and body copyWhat you say, matters. One time I took the word FREE out of a subject line, and that alone improved Deliverability by 7%! Stay away from known spammy words/phrases like “click here”, “opportunity”, “free”, "

This service is charged at $2.50 per 1,000 email verifications.Ramp-Up Model:Every new sub-account on the LC Email System will follow the \"Ramp Up Model.\"The reason for utilizing this approach is to build the reputation of a sending domain gradually so your emails will be much more likely to avoid spam filters.The email limits are multiplied each day by the number of days (until the 8th day) the sub-account has been active. Starting the 8th day:Sub-accounts with a Shared Domain will have a limit set to 15,000 emails per day. Sub-accounts with a Dedicated Domain will have a limit set to 450,000 emails per day. DayEmail Limit1250250031,00042,50055,00067,500710,0008th Day & OngoingShared domain: 150,00Dedicated domain: 450,000Please Note:The daily counter resets every day at midnight 00:00:01 AM UTC.

Enable the global unsubscribe option without adding an unsubscribe tag in each email.Why You Need To (& Should) Have An Unsubscribe Link In Your EmailsDigital laws might differ from country to country, but almost every country states that you must have an unsubscribe link in your email. The most popularly referenced law is -- US’s CAN-SPAM (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing) legislation enforced by the Federal Trade Commission.In May 2018, GDPR became a compulsory rule for any brand with subscribers in the EU.According to article 17 of GDPR, ‘Right to erasure,’ data subjects (subscribers) have the right to ask for their data to be deleted. In that case, data controllers have to comply with it. They have to delete any data when it’s no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected or the data holder/subjects withdraw consent for it to be used.If a contact unsubscribes from an email list, they are exercising their 'Right to erasure', and the data controller (the email list owner) has to unsubscribe them and delete their data.Non-compliance with GDPR can lead to a fine amounting to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is higher.Benefits of including an email unsubscribe link:1 . Shun customer frustration: Many subscribers consent to newsletters without knowing what they will deliver. After receiving the email copy, they realized it was irrelevant to them. Then if they want to unsubscribe from the newsletter and fail to find the link. You know how frustrating it is when you can’t see the unsubscribe link inside the email. Marketers need to understand the interests and preferences of different subscribers and allow them to opt-out of the email list. It improves the email marketing strategy’s outcome as you are allowing inactive subscribers to leave the contact list.      2. Collect feedback: You can collect valuable feedback from those subscribers who are no longer part of your contact list. You can use those feedback to understand the loopholes and optimize the email communications to meet your subscribers’ needs. 3. Enter into the inbox: Unsubscribe links increase the possibility of entering the subscribers’ inbox rather than going into the spam folders. If people search for an unsubscribe link and don’t find it, they will put that email in the spam folder. Your account can be suspended if your spam rate exceeds the open rate.4. Adapt anti-spam legislation: While including the unsubscribe link, every country has its law and order. It is compulsory in anti-spam legislation to give a predefined law for email marketers.  FAQHow to remove the default unsubscribe link added at the footer?Go to Sub-account -> Settings -> Business Profile -> General, where you can customize the opt-out message.

One Sub-domain2. Multiple Sub-domainsFrequently Asked QuestionsRelated ArticlesWhat is Mailgun?Mailgun is a third-party service we use to send emails in bulk. Similar to how we use Twilio to send text messages and calls. For new onboarding agencies, you will be using LC email by default, which is living under our Mailgun account.How much will Mailgun cost?Mailgun's Foundation plan is starting at $35/month. Learn more about Mailgun pricing here. What domain should I use?We recommend using a subdomain with Mailgun, like \"mg.mydomain.com\". Using a subdomain you will be able to send emails from your root domain e.g. \"you@mydomain.com\".If using a subdomain please make sure that you configure MX records for the subdomain for optimal delivery. This is configured within your Mailgun account. Note: You can only add domains you own. You will need to update the domain's DNS records to verify that you are an authorized owner or sender for this domain.There are two different ways to set up Mailgun with HighLevel:Pros:Cons:1. One Sub-domainYou can set up one sub-domain in Mailgun for your marketing agency domain and use that same sub-domain for email sending across all of your client accounts in HighLevelEasy setup - only need to set up one subdomain for your domain which you already have access toEmails are white-labeled to your marketing agency domain or you can buy a generic domain so it will not show any agency brandingIf your domain gets disabled (gets a bad score due to bounce rates) email will stop working for all of your clients since all of their accounts are powered by the same domain.The solution: don't send spammy emails to poor email addresses :-)2. Multiple Sub-domainsYou can set up a subdomain in Mailgun for each of your client's domains and use that subdomain for sending for their specific HighLevel account. Once you set up a unique domain/subdomain for each location to capture cold inbound emails. Learn more about Cold Email Inbound Setup here.Emails are white-labelled per the client domain If a client's domain gets disabled email only goes down for their client accountDifficult setup - time-consuming having to set up a subdomain for all of your clients and getting access to each of their domainsFrequently Asked QuestionsCurrently no frequently asked questions.

These are:Value: mxa.mailgun.org, Priority: 10Value: mxb.mailgun.org, Priority: 10Wait 24-48 hours for the records to propagate fully, and the error should disappear.If you still see the error, try adjusting the domain in the From field of the message to match the sending domain.If you're using a root domain:If your root domain already has your Email Service Provider's (ESP's) MX records in place, the best solution is to add a subdomain for your Mailgun sending. The error should be resolved once you've added the subdomain and configured Mailgun's MX records.Please Note:If your root domain doesn't have or needs MX records pointing to a hosted mailbox provider, you can add the root domain to your Mailgun account, verify the required TXT AND MX records, and send through the root domain.Remember: Only point your MX records for a domain to one source to avoid email misdirection or loss.3. Alternate Approaches:If the error persists after trying the above steps, consider these alternatives:Turn off sender address verification (on the server side with your email provider).Create a \"catch-all\" within the configuration of your email provider. This ensures that Sender Address Verification will pass when the recipient server checks the sender information for incoming emails.Understanding and troubleshooting these kinds of issues can be technical, but following these steps should help you resolve sender verification errors.This Mailgun article has more information.Too many requestsThe error means that too many email requests were sent simultaneously.

It is because we need to change the links in the email for tracking statistics.The Cname record you added when you set up in the domain provider is essential for Mailgun to track the open and click tracking, and unsubscribed.The record for email.mg.yourdomain.com should be pointing to Mailgun.org, that's how they are able to fetch data and show the email stats.If you are seeing this error when clicking the link: This site can't be reached /  says email.mg.yourdomain.com refused to connect when you have your own Mailgun domain/subdomain set upThat means the CNAME record might not be set up properly.1. To verify that, copy the red highlighted in the image above ---> email.mg.yourdomain.comDepending on the subdomain you set up with Mailgun, For example:If you set up mg.companyname.com,You will look up the cname record for email.mg.companyname.comIf you set up replies.companyname.com,You will look up the cname record for email.replies.companyname.comIf you set up support.companyname.com,You will look up the cname record for email.support.companyname.com2. Go to MX toolbox or Whatsmydns to look up the Cname record:        MX toolbox:Whatsmydns:3. If it says DNS records not found:    a. login to your domain provider     b. Go to DNS records and check the CNAME record4. If it is already pointing to mailgun.org:    a. Go to Mailgun -> Click the Sending tab on the left -> Domain Settings    b. Edit the Tracking Protocol    c. Send the email test again from HighLevel        Here's How to Enable HTTPS Tracking Links5. If the info above does not help, please get in touch with the support team of your domain provider for assistance. You can show them we need to add these records here:   6. If the domain provider verified all DNS records are good to go, please reach out to HL support.Common issues:1.

This could be due to several factors like incorrect Mailgun setup, faulty MX records, or issues with domain providers like WIX. Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issues efficiently.Covered in this ArticleTroubleshooting When email replies are not coming back to the Conversation1.

If you are on LC Email, move on to Step 2How to setup Replies in MailGun2. How to check MX recordsThe MX record is essential for Mailgun to track the replies tracking.  1. Switch to agency view > Settings > Email Services > Location Settings > Copy the domain/subdomain set up for the sub-account 2. Go to Mxtoolbox to look up the MX record for the subdomain/domain you copiedDepending on the subdomain you set up with Mailgun, For example:If you set up companyname.com,You will look up the MX record for companyname.comIf you set up replies.companyname.com,You will look up the MX record for replies.companyname.comto see if two records point to mxa.mailgun.org and mxb.mailgun.org.If they are missing, We must add mxa.mailgun.org and mxb.mailgun.org and set priority 10 for both MX records.Suppose other records point to other email servers like (e.g., Google Workspace). We can only choose one here, so you must either set up a subdomain for Mailgun or not use the domain for other email servers like (e.g., Google Workspace).  More information:Can I Use the Same Domain Name for Mailgun and Google Apps (Or Another Email Server)?If it's still not working, please share a screenshot of all the DNS records in your domain provider and reach out to our support here (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.). You can also check with your domain provider's support and see what is missing.3. Check if you are using the Root domain with Google Workspace and Mailgun If you are setting up a root domain to use with Mailgun, Ensure it is not pointing to somewhere else like Google Workspace, as it might contradict Google Workspace or Outlook, where you use the same domain for work emails. More information on Can I Use the Same Domain Name for Mailgun and Google Apps (Or Another Email Server)?   If you use the Mxtoolbox to look up the MX record for the root domain, it is pointing to Mailgun, as shown in the screenshot below, and other email servers (e.g., Google Workspace). We can only choose either one here, so you will need to either set up a subdomain for Mailgun or don't use the domain for other email servers like (e.g., Google Workspace)4. Double-check DNS recordsLog in to Mailgun - 1. Expand Sending tab2. Click the last menu item, Domain Settings3. Make sure you select the correct domain/subdomain for the location on top4. Click DNS records on the top middle5. Click Verify DNS settings and see if all 5 DNS records, especially the MX record, have a green checkmark?Sometimes it might show if they have all green checkmarks, but it might not be the case; you will need to click the Verify DNS Settings button again to refresh the record:    5.

SMS, Calls, Emails, etc for all your clients get hampered if your credit balance goes below $0. How can I Rebill the usage to my clients?If you are on the pro plan or higherLC Communication system is designed to work better with SaaS compared to Twilio or Mailgun. There are some inherent benefits of using LC Communications likeInstantaneous billing (no lag from Twilio webhooks)Built-in ramp for new sub-accounts (locations) so that a new client doesn't run up your bill. This improves our agency's cash flow. Error rate & Bounce rate monitoring to identify bad listsOpt-out & Unsubscribe monitoring for spam reduction Carrier complaints & violation monitoring for AUP violations to protect the sender's reputationIf you are on the pro plan or higher, you can easily rebill this usage to your clients using SaaS Mode (Phone & Email rebilling) and also include a markup to make a profit on the rebilling.We no longer apply a markup when rebilling carrier charges and A2P 10DLC charges. This means that we pass along the original charges without any additional markup. Sometimes, customers may create a ticket with the expectation that their earnings will be exactly 2x, 3x, or 3.5x the amount they spend. However, this is not the case because we do not markup compliance charges and carrier fee charges.Please refer toConnecting your Agency Stripe Account to collect rebilling paymentsHow to enable Email RebillingGeneral SaaS Mode Setup and Phone RebillingThe rebilling is designed such that HighLevel invoices yo"

It ensures that the phone number you are trying to reach is valid and capable of receiving SMS messages. The validation process involves checking the format of the phone number and verifying its existence with the telecommunication provider.If SMS Validation has been activated, we will check Twilio Lookup (charges per lookup) to see if the number is a landline and won't send any messages to it.Twilio Lookup also invalidates numbers that are badly formatted or don't exist.Validation is only performed when an SMS is queued before sending, not during Contact Import/Creation. If the number is identified as a landline number, we will not send even the first message to the carriers.Validation only needs to be activated in HighLevel to function (it is on by default in Twilio).Step 1: Switch to the location account level -> Go to Settings -> Business Info -> GeneralStep 2: Go to Agency Settings -> Twilio -> A new column called SMS ValidationPLEASE NOTE: Phone number validation is a paid service from Twilio.

Number is a landline number (Number validation)When number validation is enabled, HighLevel checks if the contact's phone number is SMS-capable before attempting to send the SMS. If the number is not SMS-capable, HighLevel skips sending the SMS and shows an error in the conversations screen.Related help doc - SMS / Phone number Validation is LIVE3. Sub-Account is new and undergoing ramped sendingFor newly created sub-accounts, HighLevel gradually increases the sending limits to prevent spamming or phishing. Agencies can choose to remove these restrictions if desired.Related help doc - LC - Phone Messaging Policy (See 1. Ramp-Up Model: section)4. Sub-Account has exhausted the daily quota set by the agencyAgencies can set a daily limit on SMS sending for each sub-account. When the limit is reached, HighLevel skips sending SMS in bulk actions and automations. However, 1:1 SMS messages are still sent to allow clients to reply to their leads. Agencies have control over these limits for each sub-account.Related help doc - LC - Phone Messaging Policy (See How to update the limit for a sub-account? section)5. Sub-Account SMS sending privileges have been suspended due to a high error rate, opt-out rate, or carrier complaint rateHighLevel monitors error rates, opt-out rates, and carrier complaint rates for all sub-accounts to prevent spamming and phishing. If any of these thresholds are exceeded, SMS sending privileges for the sub-account are suspended for a certain period. Any attempted SMS sending during this time will be skipped, and an error message will be displayed on the conversation screen.Related help doc - Best Practices for SMS deliverability and Avoiding SMS RestrictionsAt the Twilio/LC Phone Layer:1. Number is on Twilio's DND list due to a previous opt-out or carrier complaint.If the contact's number opted out from the Twilio number before, SMS will not be delivered unless the contact opted in by texting START to the Twilio number.2. 30001 - Queue overflowTwilio queues messages based on the sending rate of the sender or account. Messages can only be queued for up to 4 hours before they automatically fail. The queue length limit can be reduced by setting a lower Validity Period within your Messaging Service settings or API requests.3. 30002 - Sub-Account suspended on the Twilio sideIf your Twilio sub-account is suspended between the time of message send and delivery, please contact Twilio or HighLevel Support (LC Phone). This failure occurs when your account was suspended after the message was queued but before it was sent by Twilio.At Sender Carrier Network Layer1. 30003 - Unreachable destination handsetThe destination handset you are trying to reach is switched off or otherwise unavailable.The device you are trying to reach does not have sufficient signalThe device cannot receive SMS (for example, the phone number belongs to a landline)There is an issue with the mobile carrier2. 30004 - Message blockedThe destination number you are trying to reach is blocked from receiving this message.The device you are trying to reach does not have sufficient signal.The device cannot receive SMS (for example, the phone number belongs to a landline).The destination number is on India's national Do Not Call registry.There is an issue with the mobile carrier.You"

All businesses are required to partake in these registrations. Submissions are required, reviewed, and processed through the federal government. HighLevel has no part in the vetting or approval process after submission. It might feel like a lot but it is required and part of doing business - so let's make the best of it, together! Let's jump in and learn how to get our numbers registered.TABLE OF CONTENTSUS Number Registration is a Federal RequirementWhat is A2P 10DLC and the TCR?Who Needs to Complete a Phone Registration?How Long Does it Take to Get Approved?Avoid Failures and Get the Fastest Approval Time PossibleTypes of RegistrationThe Registration ProcessRegistration Comparison TableFAQsIs Cold Texting Allowed?What if I do not have a valid Tax ID, how do I register my phone number?What is A2P 10DLC and the TCR?A2P10 DLC is a phone number registration process mandated by the United States government, specifically through The Campaign Registry (TCR). It is a required registration process for any business or individual engaging with a U.S. audience via outbound SMS. The purpose is to ensure legitimacy and adherence to guidelines when sending marketing and promotional text messages.“A2P” is short for Application to Person. In this case, HighLevel is the application, and the recipient you wish to send SMS or MMS to is the person.“10 DLC” is short for 10 Digit Long Code. This is both the number of digits US phone numbers contain as well as the name of the new standard.\"The Campaign Registry (TCR)\" works with North American mobile operators and companies that are in the messaging business to register Application-to-Person (A2P) text messaging Campaigns. The registry supports a sanctioned A2P 10 Digit Long Code (10DLC) text messaging Campaign ecosystem and provides visibility into the messaging source and content, allowing mobile carriers to provide a more reliable and simple messaging service for Campaign Service Providers (CSPs) and BrandsWho Needs to Complete a Phone Registration? Anyone sending an SMS or MMS to a U.S. audience.How Long Does it Take to Get Approved?Regardless of the registration type, it can take 4 to 6 weeks to receive the results. Many submission results do return much sooner than 4 to 6 weeks - but we cannot guarantee any time frame for submission results. Many factors impact the vetting process and HighLevel has no control over the speed of submission review. After submission, it is up to The Campaign Registry (TCR) to determine approval status based on your submission information. It's important to be detailed before submitting to save time and avoid a failed submission.Avoid Failures and Get the Fastest Approval Time PossibleHighLevel has no part in the vetting or approval process after submission. However, we do try our best to help you provide a detailed and accurate submission to ensure a review can take place.PRO TIP: Reviewing common reasons for failure BEFORE submitting your Brand or Campaign will help avoid common failure reasons and ensure the fastest approval time possible. Submitting accurate information during your first submission will assist in a faster review.Types of RegistrationThere are four main types of Phone Registration and each have a specific use-case and pros and cons. We will learn more about each in the \"Registration Comparison Table\" below.Toll-Free NumberMany users find the Toll-Free (TF) Registration process simpler. In addition, TF has no Tax ID requirement, has no registration fees, and no daily sending limit. However, Toll-Free numbers may have lower open/pick-up rates compared to local ones.Sole PropSole Props allow businesses without a Tax ID and with only one employee to get a local number. Customers with EIN number and/or with two or more employees are NOT ELIGIBLE for Sole Prop. Requires a US or Canada business address. Daily sending limit is 3,000 segments. Only allowed one phone number.Low Volume StandardBest for businesses with a Tax ID and who are sending less than 6,000 segments a day. Daily sending limit is 6,000. StandardFor businesses with a Tax ID who are sending more than 6,000 segments per day. No daily sending limit though some restrictions may apply for sending above 200,000 daily segments.We will learn more about each in the \"Registration Comparison Table\" section below.The Registration ProcessThere is a three-step process to having your numbers vetted and approved before you can send SMS.

This mobile terms of service should include specific provisions such as customer support contact information, complete opt-out instructions (displayed in bold), a recurring message disclosure (if applicable), a product description, and a program (brand) name. Additional requirements may exist for certain programs like sweepstakes or contests. For more information on industry standards, please refer to the CTIA’s Short Code Monitoring Handbook.Beyond these standards, there may be additional compliance requirements under applicable law based on the nature of your text messaging campaign. It is advisable to consult with your legal counsel to ensure that your terms of service and privacy policy are compliant with applicable law and consistent with standards for your specific campaign and industry.New Sev-0 Fines on Prohibited A2P Traffic, Effective February 15, 2024What do you need to know?  T-Mobile has introduced A2P 10DLC non-compliance fines for messages including prohibited content. If T-Mobile detects any messages that violate the tiers listed below, they will issue a Sev-0 violation (the most severe consumer violation), a non-compliance fine, and carriers will immediately block the offending messages.This applies to all commercial messaging non-consumer A2P products (SMS or MMS short code, toll-free, and 10DLC) that traverse the T-Mobile network.Because Sev-0 violations also infringe on HighLevel acceptable use and messaging policies, HighLevel will pass on these fines to you for every Sev-0 violation, starting February 15, 2024. These fines include, but are not limited to, the following:Tier 1: $2,000: phishing (including simulated phishing sent for security testing or similar purposes), smishing, and social engineering. Social Engineering is a technique used to manipulate someone into sharing private information, like passwords or credit card numbers.Tier 2: $1,000: illegal content (content must be legal federally and in all 50 states)Tier 3: $500: all other violations in commercial messaging including but not limited to, SHAFT (sex, hate, alcohol, firearms, and tobacco) that do not follow federal and state law and regulations (e.g. age-gate).These non-compliance fines apply to violations across any A2P messaging product (SMS/MMS short code, toll-free, and 10DLC). T-Mobile reserves the right to permanently suspend any brands, campaigns, and your company’s access to the T-Mobile Network in the event violations are deemed to be excessive. If you are subject to these fines, HighLevel will send you a Sev-0 violation notice and will subse"

This article summarizes how Brand approval works and our best practices to ensure your Brand is approved.Covererd in this Article:How Brand Approval WorksHow To Maximize Your Trust ScoreUse a valid EIN for US-based companies – not a DUNS numberHow to find your EIN (for US companies)Use a Valid Tax ID for companies based outside of the U.S.Guidance for companies in CanadaGuidance for companies in the rest of the worldCommon customer errors for EIN/Tax IDFurther recommendations:Check Your Business AddressSupported Stock ExchangesOther FactorsFrequently Asked QuestionsIf you are getting this error \"Maximum 3 tries exhausted, please reach out to support team for next steps.\", please provide the location ID: Is an EIN mandatory and what do businesses outside the US use for Standard Barnd Registration?I received an error stating “We are unable to retrieve your TCR Trust Score” What does that mean?I received an error message stating, “Your brand registration failed” what does that mean?I received a low Trust Score; how can I increase the score?Another company acquired my company; whose information do I provide?My company’s business information has changed; how can I update my A2P Brand? How Brand Approval WorksThe approval process starts with a primary vetting of your brand completed by The Campaign Registry. As part of the approval process, LC Phone will automatically submit your brand for Secondary Vetting, an additional review process that can lead to increased throughput and messaging limits. Once that vetting is completed, you will receive a Trust Score that determines your long code messaging throughput to US networks and daily message limits to T-Mobile as described in Message throughput MPS and Trust Scores for A2P 10DLC in the US. For a full walkthrough of the Brand registration process, please see our A2P 10DLC Onboarding Guide. How To Maximize Your Trust ScoreTo ensure your Brand is approved and you receive the most accurate Trust Score, you want to submit your business data properly. Below are some best practices to follow along with some frequently asked questions regarding Brand registration.Use a valid EIN for US-based companies – not a DUNS numberThe provided EIN and Legal Company Name must match business registration sources for private and public for-profit companies. Please ensure: For Standard A2P 10DLC brand registration, customers with a US presence must use an EIN.A DUNS number is unacceptable for US companies creating Standard A2P Brand registrations. A DUNS number should only be used in Business Profile creation if you do not want to use US A2P messaging and only want to use Stir/Shaken for Voice.For Non-Profit and Political Organizations, the EIN has to match the Legal Company Name available in the Tax-Exempt Organizations or Registered Political Organizations list. Learn more in Nonprofit and Government Guide to A2P 10DLC Text Messaging.Enter your Legal Company Name exactly as registered with the IRSIf you’re registering a US entity, please enter the exact Legal Company Name as registered with the IRS, which can be found on the CP 575 EIN Confirmation Letter.
